Assignment #1 - Week 2
========================

Part 1:  Loading and preprocessing the data

First we will load the required packages:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
```

Next we read in the data set:
```{r}
activity <- read_csv("~/activity.csv")
```

Part 2: What is the mean total number of steps taken per day.  

First, the histogram of the total number of steps per day:
```{r}
#Aggregate by day
bydate <- aggregate(activity["steps"], by=activity["date"], sum)

#Plot the histogram
hist(bydate$steps, 
     main="Histogram for Number of Steps", 
     xlab="# of Steps",
     ylab="# of Days",
     col="light blue",
     las=1, 
     breaks=5)
```

Next calculate and report the mean total number of steps taken per day:
```{r}
#Calculate Mean (Removed NA Values)
mean(bydate$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Then calculate and report the median number of steps taken per day:
```{r}
#Calculate Mean (Removed NA Values)
median(bydate$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```
